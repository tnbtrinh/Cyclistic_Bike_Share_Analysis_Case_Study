# Cyclistic bike share analysis casestudy
Analyze a dataset using R for a fictional bike sharing company in Chicago and show how annual subscribers and casual customers use Cyclistic bikes differently

## Casestudy background
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes thecompanyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual customers and annual subscribers use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, they will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual customers into annual subscribers. 

I am assuming to be a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic. And I will be responsible for analyzing the data that the team provided and present to the stakeholders

#### Business task
Find the marketing strategy to convert casual customers to annual subscribers

## Process
I used R programming platform to clean, explore and analyze the data.

The datasource has too many files from different years, I decide to use the data in 2018 which contains 4 files for 4 quarters > I upload the files to R > Inspect all the columns to make sure they are consistent > Combine 4 files into one single dataframe to explore >  Eplore the mean/sum/median, etc of the ride length between two usertype to compare if it is worth investing more on casual customers > Visualize on R to have a better understanding > Save the data in .csv file > Use Tableau to visualize the insights to present to stakeholders.

## Business suggestion/Act
Emphasize the benefits of memberships, including discounts during busy times of the year during peak months or peak days of a week.

Invest more advertisements or banners at the popular start/end stations to attact attention.

Offer discounts for longer rides as casual customers use the bikes more longer duration than annual subscribers.
